# Todo App




# **Web app - Todo list**

# **Goal**

Please implement a todo list app with web technologies, including HTML5, javascript, and CSS and also with a backend to persist the data and provide API endpoints to query/manipulate the data.

# **Timeline**

**3 hours**

# **What we would like to see during the demo**

Frontend: SPA (single page application)

Backend: API endpoints to create/read/update the todo list item.

**Must have features**

1. Create a new todo item
2. List all the items
3. Mark a specific item as complete
4. Uncheck a complete item

**Project prioritization**

A person can spend one week, or even more, building a polished experience for an todo list. We are asking you to build a todo list app in a few hours. This means that you’ll need to make some trade-offs along the way. We want to understand those trade-offs (for example, maybe you chose not to have a polished UI so that you can have more time creating a better backend APIs, please share this during your presentation).

**Bonus**

Besides the above must-have features, you may take a look at the reference spec below and pick more features to implement to showcase your skillset.

**Clean code and architecture**

## Tech. Stack

You may choose any frameworks, react.js, Vue.js or Angular.js, there is no limitation on this.

The same for backend, you can choose whatever tech. stack you want, though node.js is preferred. :)
