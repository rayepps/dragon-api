# ✍ Backend Engineer Coding Challenge
## Goal
To implement a photo sharing system so that anyone can upload a picture and it provides API endpoints to list/delete the photos.

## Timeline
3 hours

## What we would like to see during the demo
Backend: API endpoints to create/read/update/delete the photos.
Frontend: not needed, this is a pure backend challenge.

## Must have features

1. Upload a photo
2. Add a title and description to the photo
3. List all the photos, the returned data should contain urls to access thumbnail
4. Read a specific photo, including the full picture, the title, and the description
5. Change the title and description of the photo
6. Delete the photo
7. End result must be deployed on a public Cloud (Heroku, AWS, etc all have free tiers)

## Project prioritization

A person can spend one week, or even more, building a robust system for photo sharing. We are asking you to build one in a few hours. This means that you’ll need to make some trade-offs along the way. We want to understand those trade-offs (for example, maybe you chose not to have a more secure system so that you can have more time creating a easy-to-use backend APIs, please share this during your presentation).

## Bonus

- Good API design
- Clean code and architecture

## Tech. Stack

You may choose any tech. stacks, languages and frameworks you want, no matter it is node.js, Golang, java, there is no limitation on this. It's OK to try something new, just let us know that you are doing so. We don't care if you use something we don't; the goal is to showcase your thinking, not your knowledge of a particular language.

You can also leverage some cloud infra. if you think that's easier, like aws, GCP, or Azure, but please do describe what you choose and the reasoning behind this.

## Optional Bonus Tasks

- Add the ability to search for photos based on the metadata.
- Add unit testing.
